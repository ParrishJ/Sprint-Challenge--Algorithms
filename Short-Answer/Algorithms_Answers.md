#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
Runtime: constant O(1)

In the worst case scenario, the function will only run twice for any input, no matter how large. 


b)
Runtime: Linearithmic O(n log n)

In the worst case scenario, the runtime will increase faster than at a linear rate as n increases, however the runtime will grow slightly less than at a polynomial rate due to the while loop. 

c)
Runtime: Linear O(n)

In the worst case scenario, the number of times that the bunnyEars function runs is directly proportional to the number of bunnies passed to the function.
